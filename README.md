# Our first program
print("Hello World")

- python3 --version : to see python version

# Python character set
- Letters -> A to Z, a to z
- Digits - 0 to 9
- Special symbol - + * / etc

- print("surya, s nair") output: surya, s nair
- print("surya", "s nair") output: surya s nair
- print (23) output: 23
- print (35+23)  output: 58

# Variables
Is a name given to a memory location in a program

**Syntax:** variable = value

eg: name = "Surya"

    age = 23
    
    price = 25.99

- name = "Surya"
  
  print(name)

  output: Surya

-  name = "Surya"

    age = 23
    
    price = 25.99

    print("name","age","price") ---> output : name age price

- name = "Surya"

    age = 23
    
    price = 25.99

    print(name,age,price) ---> output : surya 23 25.99

- name = "Surya"

    age = 23
    
    price = 25.99

    print("my name is : ", name)
  
    print("my age is : ", age)
  
    print("my price is : ", price)

    output: my name is :  Surya
  
    my age is :  23
  
    my price is :  25.99

-   name = "Surya"

    age = 23
    
    price = 25.99

    age2=age

    print(age)

    output: 23

- name = "Surya"

    age = 23
    
    price = 25.99

    print(type(name))
    
    print(type(age))
    
    print(type(price))

    output: <class 'str'>
  
    <class 'int'>
  
    <class 'float'>

**Note:** we cannot print a function which we defined.
